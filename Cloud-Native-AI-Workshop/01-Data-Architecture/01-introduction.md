# Data Architecture for Cloud-Native AI 

refers to the design and implementation of data systems that support AI/ML workloads using cloud-first, scalable, distributed, and API-driven infrastructures. In the AI era, data systems must be capable of handling large-scale, real-time, multimodal data across hybrid and multicloud environments. The goal is to enable:

✅ Rapid data ingestion
✅ Efficient data transformation and feature preparation
✅ AI model training, inferencing, monitoring, and continuous improvement
✅ Secure, governed, and compliant data usage
