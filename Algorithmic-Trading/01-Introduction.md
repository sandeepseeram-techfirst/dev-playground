# Introduction 

- Markets are driven by the fundamental economic forces of supply and demand. The market price of a commodity should reflect the equilibrium price based on available supply (sellers) and available demand (buyers).

# Key Takeaways

* Complexity breeds fragility: The more interconnected and automated a system, the more vulnerable it is to cascading failure.

* Black swans are not always unforeseeable â€” they often emerge from ignored tail risks or human overconfidence in models.

* Risk management, testing, change control, and circuit breakers are crucial in modern markets.
