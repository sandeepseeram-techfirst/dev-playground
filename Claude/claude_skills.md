### Skills vs. CLAUDE.md vs. Slash Commands

Claude Code has several ways to customize behavior. Skills are unique because they're automatic and task-specific. Here's how they compare:

**CLAUDE.md** files load into every conversation. If you want Claude to always use TypeScript's strict mode, that goes in CLAUDE.md.

**Skills** load on demand when they match your request. Claude only loads the name and description initially, so they don't fill up your entire context window. Your PR review checklist doesn't need to be in context when you're debugging — it loads when you actually ask for a review.

**Slash commands** require you to explicitly type them. Skills don't. Claude applies them when it recognizes the situation.
