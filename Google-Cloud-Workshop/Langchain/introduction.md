# LangChain 

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) — such as chatbots, agents, and AI-driven workflows — by connecting language models with external data, tools, and APIs in a structured way.

TL;DR LangChain makes the complicated parts of working and building with language models easier. It helps do this in two ways:

### Integration  
Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and API data, to LLMs. 

### Agents 
Allows LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making and use LLMs to help decide which action to take next.
