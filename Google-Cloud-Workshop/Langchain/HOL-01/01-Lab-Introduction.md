## Building AI-powered data-driven applications using pgvector, LangChain and LLMs

Python application that will be able to understand and respond to human language queries about the relational data stored in your PostgreSQL database. 

### Dataset:

The dataset for this notebook has been sampled and created from a larger public retail dataset available at Kaggle. The sampled dataset used in this notebook has only about 800 toy products, while the public dataset has over 370,000 products in different categories.

### The goals are:

(Usecase 1) For buyers: Build a new AI-powered hybrid search, where users can describe their needs in simple English text, along with regular filters (like price, etc.)

(Usecase 2) For sellers: Add a new AI-powered content generation feature, where sellers will get auto-generated item description suggestions for new products that they want to add to the platform.
