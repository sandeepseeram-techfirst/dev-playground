# 01 - Build your own small language model 

### Language 

Globally, there are between 6-7 thousand languages, and yet remarkably, many of them follow similar patterns. Languages are governed by rules that dictate the order of words and the formation of word groups. This underlying structure means that much of language is predictable.

* Language models can be used to generate music or predict weather patterns and simulate our climate. These models can even represent proteins, paving way for breakthroughs in drug discovery.

* Language is one of the most powerful and diverse tools that humans possess. There are estimated to be roughly one million words in the English language including scientific terms

* Despite their diversity, most languages share common patterns such as syntax (the way words are put together), semantics (the meanings of words and their combinations), and contextual dependencies. These common patterns make them understandable and more importantly, learnable. It is this universal learnability that makes building language models possible.

### The Rise of Language Models

* Deep Learning, a sophisticated class of machine learning methods and its the foundation to modern language models (LMs). 

* At its core, a language model (LM) is a system that predicts the next word in a sequence based on previous words. This is done by assigning probabilities to all possible next words and then choosing the next word based on these probabilities. The probabilities themselves are generally learned by the model from large amounts of data using machine learning methods, such as deep learning.
