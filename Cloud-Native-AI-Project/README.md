# Cloud Native AI Project 

## Goal 
Build a MVP, production-like Cloud Native AI pipeline that runs on Kubernetes. 

The final product is a web-app + REST inference endpoint for an image-classifier (MNIST/CIFAR toy model) that can be presented in a demo. 

The lab covers data storage, training, CI-style orchestration, model packaging, model serving, autoscaling, observability, secrets, and a basic frontend.
