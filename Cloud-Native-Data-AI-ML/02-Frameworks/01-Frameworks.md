# ‚öôÔ∏è In-Depth Technical Introduction: Cloud Native Data, AI, and ML Frameworks

## üß≠ Overview

Cloud Native AI/ML frameworks are designed to **run data and machine learning workloads seamlessly in containerized, scalable, and portable environments** ‚Äî usually orchestrated by **Kubernetes**.

They bring **automation, reproducibility, scalability, and resilience** to data and ML systems.

At a high level, these frameworks fall into three layers:

1. **Data Frameworks** ‚Äî Collect, process, and manage data
2. **AI/ML Frameworks** ‚Äî Train and evaluate machine learning/deep learning models
3. **MLOps & Cloud Native Integration Frameworks** ‚Äî Operationalize models at scale
