# üå©Ô∏è Cloud Native AI/ML ‚Äî Complete Technical Overview & Expert Roadmap

## üìò Introduction

**Cloud Native AI/ML** is the convergence of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Cloud Native technologies**.  

It focuses on building **scalable, portable, resilient, and efficient AI/ML systems** using **cloud-native principles** such as containerization, orchestration, declarative configuration, and microservices.

Cloud Native AI/ML enables:
- Running ML workloads seamlessly across **hybrid and multi-cloud environments**
- Managing **data pipelines**, **model training**, and **inference workloads** efficiently using Kubernetes
- Leveraging **MLOps** to automate the lifecycle of ML models
- Integrating **GPU acceleration**, **serverless inference**, and **AI-driven observability** within cloud-native infrastructure

## üß© Core Domains in Cloud Native AI/ML

| Domain | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Data Engineering** | Data ingestion, transformation, feature extraction, and pipeline orchestration using tools like Apache Beam, Spark, and Kubeflow Pipelines. |
| **Model Development** | Designing, training, and evaluating models using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, often with distributed training on Kubernetes. |
| **Model Serving & Inference** | Scalable deployment and serving of ML models using Seldon Core, KServe, BentoML, or NVIDIA Triton. |
| **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** | Automating ML lifecycle ‚Äî CI/CD for ML models, experiment tracking, versioning, monitoring, and drift detection. |
| **AI Infrastructure** | Using GPU/TPU nodes, autoscaling clusters, storage optimization, and distributed compute for high-performance AI workloads. |
| **AI Observability & Monitoring** | Metrics, logs, and traces for ML pipelines using Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, and model-specific monitoring. |
| **Security & Governance** | Data privacy, model integrity, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA), and RBAC in ML pipelines and Kubernetes environments. |
