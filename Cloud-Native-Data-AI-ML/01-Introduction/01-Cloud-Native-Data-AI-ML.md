# 🌩️ Cloud Native AI/ML — Complete Technical Overview & Expert Roadmap

## 📘 Introduction

**Cloud Native AI/ML** is the convergence of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Cloud Native technologies**.  

It focuses on building **scalable, portable, resilient, and efficient AI/ML systems** using **cloud-native principles** such as containerization, orchestration, declarative configuration, and microservices.

Cloud Native AI/ML enables:
- Running ML workloads seamlessly across **hybrid and multi-cloud environments**
- Managing **data pipelines**, **model training**, and **inference workloads** efficiently using Kubernetes
- Leveraging **MLOps** to automate the lifecycle of ML models
- Integrating **GPU acceleration**, **serverless inference**, and **AI-driven observability** within cloud-native infrastructure
